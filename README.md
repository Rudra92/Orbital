# Orbital

Game developped for LauzHack during 1 weekend

We did our own approach for the popular game Sagittarius (https://gprosser.itch.io/sagittarius)

We developed the same mechanics - random planets, random placement, archery shooting with gravity- and added our own spice to it. Powerups! Once in a while small Mario-like powerups will popup in the map and touching them with arrows grant them for the next shot. 

Powerups include 
-> Jump once, try to reach other planets!
-> Arrows explode on contact killing everything in its radius!
-> Widespray, launching multiple arrows at once.

Photos available under the CheckItOut folder.

Enjoy the gravity as much as we did!
